This app is designed to scrape and display ski reports from a website.
It offers a quick and user-friendly interface to fetch the latest ski condition reports.
The data scraping functionality used in this app likely goes against the terms and conditions of 
the website it scrapes data from. For that reason, this app will not be published to the app store. 
I just thought this would be a fun idea for the assignment.
Unfortunately the ski season is over now, so the reports on the website aren't being updated anymore
but this app does have the ability to regularly update if the website was also regularly updated.

When the app is launched a new ski report must be generated. 
There's no saved data from previous sessions, so that users always get the most recent report available.

Ski reports are saved in a cache while the app is open, this caching system allows the user to
quickly switch between reports that have already been loaded.
Users can refresh the ski report by swiping down on the screen when they have a report open.
A string will display when the report was last refreshed.

A splash screen is displayed on opening the app, however this is purely for aesthetics and does not
perform any setup or initialisation.

A secondary splash screen is displayed when loading a ski report, this screen displays the logo of 
the ski area the user is generating the report for and a progress bar as well. 
This splash screen provides visual indicator that the app is loading a ski report.

I am aware the project was incorrectly named `assingment3` instead of the correct `assignment3`, but 
this has no impact on usability or functionality.
